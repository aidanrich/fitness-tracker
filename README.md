# fitness-tracker

## Description
- We were asked to finish an app that tracks your workout routine by adding a model and routes for a mongo database.
- This app let's you keep track of various forms of exercise and aggregates various stats from your workouts.
- This project helped us learn about MongoDB, Mongoose and Robo 3T.
